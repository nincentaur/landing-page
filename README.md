I am truly not into TOP front-end projects because I find that I spend too much time designing/making it aesthetic, and I'd rather be coding my own things. I did a brief exploration into C++ not too long ago and loved it. I can't wait to dig into that again. However, I want to finish this Odin Foundations course for consistency's sake... so here I am.  
Update 1: This is actually kind of fun. Since I am using the default colors provided by TOP and I may or may not leave the image boxes empty, I can concentrate on gridding/layout.  
Update 2: To be completely frank and as some of you already surmised, my initial, begrudging resistance had nothing to do with aesthetics. Aesthetics are incredibly fun to play with once everything is laid out as desired. But yea, flexbox can be super frustrating if you don't know how to make the boxes fit each other. Glad I pushed through my stubborness in the beginning. I learned a lot... and the struggle seared all that knowledge into my memory lol. Anyway, the site came out cute, hope you like :)
