I am truly not into TOP front-end projects because I find that I spend too much time designing/making it aesthetic, and I'd rather be coding my own things. I did a brief exploration into C++ not too long ago and loved it. I can't wait to dig into that again. However, I want to finish this Odin Foundations course for consistency's sake... so here I am.  
Update 1: This is actually kind of fun. Since I am using the default colors provided by TOP and I may or may not leave the image boxes empty, I can concentrate on gridding/layout.
