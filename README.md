I am truly not into TOP front-end projects because I find that I spend too much time designing/making it aesthetic, and I'd rather be coding my own things. I did a brief exploration into C++ not too long ago and loved it. I can't wait to dig into that again. However, I want to finish this Odin Foundations course for consistency's sake... so here I am.
